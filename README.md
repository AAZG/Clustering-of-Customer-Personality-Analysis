# Clustering of Customer Personality Analysis

Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.

Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.

## Motivation.
Learn and practice within the branch of data science.


## Problem it solves.
Need for grouping to summarize customer segments.

## Completed.
- Data cleaning and Data preprocessing
- Imputation Missing data to KNN
- EDA: Univariate and multivariate analysis
- Scaling Data and PCA
- Clustering with KMeans, Agglomerative Clustering, DBSCAN, AffinityPropagation, MeanShift, SpectralClustering

## Characteristics.
* The project was done in a jupyter labs notebook.
* Within the project there are observations as the analysis progresses.
* You can interact with many of the charts since the Plotly library was used.


## Participants.
The project was carried out individually.
